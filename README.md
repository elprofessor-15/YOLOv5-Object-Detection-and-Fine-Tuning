# YOLOv5-Object-Detection-and-Fine-Tuning

This repository contains an implementation of object detection using the YOLOv5 model on a custom set of images. It includes steps for setting up the environment, running pre-trained YOLOv5 for object detection, and fine-tuning the model on custom datasets for improved performance. Additionally, the repository provides code for visualizing detections with bounding boxes and exporting results.

Feel free to modify or expand this based on specific details of your project!
